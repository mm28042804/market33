Overview Of Synthetic Diamonds Market

Synthetic diamonds are lab-grown or laboratory produced diamond, its physical and chemical properties resemble to those of natural diamonds. Synthetic diamonds (lab-grown diamonds) are also known as cultivated or cultured diamonds. These are manufactured in the laboratory by using CVD (chemical vapor deposition) or HPHT (high pressure high temperature) processes. Synthetic diamonds exhibit properties similar to natural diamonds; hence, they are widely utilized in end-user industries that use diamonds. Increase in demand for synthetic diamond in industrial application will boost the synthetic diamond market. Synthetic diamonds are widely utilized in computer chip production, construction, machinery production, mining services (such as drilling for minerals), gem exploration, stone cutting and polishing, surgery, astronomy, experimental physics, and electronics. Synthetic diamonds are also known for their usage in oil & gas drills, as no other material is capable of handling extreme conditions. Synthetic diamond-based products are also being employed in industrial and household water treatment. Polycrystalline CVDs are an essential component in high-performance loudspeakers. Synthetic diamond detectors of ultraviolet light particles are used at high-energy research facilities and are available commercially.
