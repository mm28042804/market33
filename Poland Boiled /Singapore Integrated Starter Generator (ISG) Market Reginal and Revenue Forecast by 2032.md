# Singapore Integrated Starter Generator (ISG) Market Reginal and Revenue Forecast by 2032

<strong>Integrated Starter Generator (ISG) Market Snapshot 2025-2033 provides a concise overview of market trends, forecasts, and growth opportunities over the forecast period:</strong>

The Integrated Starter Generator (ISG) replaces the conventional starter, generator and flywheel of the engine and provides an auxiliary function as a convenient automatic vehicle start-stop system for further improved fuel efficiency

Like a conventional alternator, the ISG produces electric power when the vehicle is running, which is used to supply electric devices and/or to charge the battery. The ISG can help to decelerate the vehicle by generating electric power, which is called regenerative braking. The electric power generated charges the battery, reducing fuel consumption. If a clutch disconnects the ISG and the compressor from the engine during the idle stop, the ISG can drive the air-conditioning compressor via a belt.
